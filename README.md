# FlickerDraft
Well, this project is written in Swift 5, use on iOS device, and with Flicker API, JSON support on request & response.

In this draft, I just includes one method, ```flickr.photos.search```. 
Since Flicker is not that popular and hard to access in China =.=! I will dive into other API, so there is no extension would happen, but I have used MVC to make it more readable and you could append other API methods as your wish.

PS: That is all:) Don't forget to replace apiKey in ```FlickerClient.swift``` with your apiKey, which is applied on Flicker API website ```https://www.flickr.com/services/api/```.
